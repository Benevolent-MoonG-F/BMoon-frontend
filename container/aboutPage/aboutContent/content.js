                 <h6>A Mission-Driven Decentralized Cryptocurrency Prediction Marketplace focusing on Social Impact. Our mission, as it is stated in our name, is to pursue all we do with benevolent intent.  This objective has many layers, and we believe our reach and social impact will only grow as our community offers its voice via our DAO.  Healing the world is at the core of who we are. 
                 BMG&F is provides fun experiences for our users. While perhaps overly simple, seeking fun, joyful experiences in life is at the core of the human condition.  People spend a tremendous amount of time, money, and energy seeking fun activities in their lives- thus it a priority to make our offerings joyful.<p><br></br></p>  
                 All of our products are born from the community experience that has brought us together as a team, and has had an emotionally positive palpable effect on our lives.   We built this project for the global community, to provide joy, help heal the world where it needs, and bring people together.  Further,  our BMS DAO will ultimately render this project a completely community governed entity. 
                 All of our products will also provide for our community varied opportunities to grow financial wealth.  The variety of activities will appeal to a very wide usership, from gamers, to predictive market enthusiasts, to NFT collectors, and Defi-Degens.  United by a community led DAO, we will continue to explore opportunities to serve our community in the area of financial growth.
